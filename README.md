You can download the individual Rmd scripts from GitHub by clicking on the filename, and then the 'Raw' button. Save this file to your computer, and then open it in RStudio.
Running Lab Code
All software used for the class is free and open source:
R can be downloaded and installed from CRAN External link (Comprehensive R Archive Network). This course has moved to using R 4.1.2 or later. If possible download the latest release. As of the course's launch, that is R-4.2.0 ("Vigorous Calisthenics"), released 22 April 2022.
